# Services

####EXERCISE:** Name at least 3 angular built in services that we have used so far.
#####$http, $location, $routeParams

####EXERCISE: Read the docs for [the q promise library](https://github.com/kriskowal/q).  Why would you prefer to use a promise over a callback?  What advantage does it have?
#####Promises almost feel sychronous; they are easier to chain, error-handling is cleaner, and it's easier to create reusable code.


**EXERCISE:** Use the [Giphy Api](https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI) to add a feature to your app.  Whenever a new user is submitted, do a search for a gif using the person's name.  If you get a result, save that along with the users name email and phone number.  Show the user's gif on the show page.
